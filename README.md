🎃 A purely fully controllable react / vue / miniapp-ts application framework.

> This project draws heavily on the plug-in system of `umijs`

> Consider starring, thank you ❤️ and support.

## Features

- 🎉 **Extensible**, Zmi's plug-in system is inherited from Umi and modified to meet the hierarchical requirements of functions and vertical domains. Complete life cycle, plug-in

- 📦 **Out of the Box**, Zmi only needs one dependency to get started. vue/react/miniapp-ts

- 🚀 **Not self-researched**, preferential use of mature community solutions

- 🌴 **No routing**, no involvement in runtime, zmi is a pure scaffolding tool

- Based on the latest **webpack5**

```bash
# Create project
$ yarn create @zmi-cli/zmi-app
# or npx @zmi-cli/create-zmi-app

# Install dependency
$ cd myApp && yarn

# Start development
$ zmi dev
```
